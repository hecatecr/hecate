			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Monorepo Structure",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the monorepo initialization into subtasks for directory creation, git setup, CI/CD configuration, dependency management setup, documentation files, and validation steps. Each subtask should be independently executable.",
			"reasoning": "While conceptually straightforward, this task involves multiple independent setup steps across different tools (git, GitHub Actions, Crystal workspace). Each component requires specific configuration and validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Core Shard Foundation",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for shard.yml creation, source file structure setup, spec infrastructure, documentation creation, and build configuration. Focus on establishing the foundation that other shards will follow.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard Crystal shard setup but requires careful attention to structure since it's the foundation for all other shards. The zero-dependency requirement and module structure need proper implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement SourceFile Structure",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: basic struct definition, line offset computation algorithm, byte-to-position conversion with binary search, position-to-byte conversion, line extraction methods, edge case handling (CRLF, empty files), and comprehensive unit tests.",
			"reasoning": "The core complexity lies in efficient position calculations and handling various text formats. Binary search implementation and edge case handling require careful implementation and thorough testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Position and Span Types",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: Position struct with display conversion, Span struct with validation, comparison operators for both types, and unit tests covering all edge cases.",
			"reasoning": "These are fundamental data structures but relatively simple. The main considerations are 0-based vs 1-based indexing and span validation logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Build SourceMap Registry",

			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: basic SourceMap class structure, thread-safe file addition, ID generation system, path deduplication, virtual file support, span-to-position conversion implementation, retrieval methods, and concurrent access testing.",
			"reasoning": "Thread safety with Crystal's Mutex, efficient lookups, and proper span-to-position conversion across multiple files add significant complexity. The concurrent access patterns need careful testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Design Diagnostic Data Structure",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: Severity enum definition, Label struct with style enum, core Diagnostic class, builder pattern groundwork, and unit tests for all components.",
			"reasoning": "The data structures themselves are straightforward, but the design needs to support the builder pattern and handle multiple labels elegantly. The immutability constraints add some complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Diagnostic Builder API",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: DiagnosticBuilder class implementation, fluent API methods (primary, secondary, help, note), module-level helper functions, method chaining validation, and comprehensive API tests.",
			"reasoning": "The builder pattern is well-understood but requires careful implementation for proper method chaining. The module-level helpers need to integrate smoothly with the builder."
		},

			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: basic renderer class structure, header formatting, source grouping logic, line number formatting, source line extraction, basic output methods, NO_COLOR handling, width-aware formatting, and snapshot testing setup.",
			"reasoning": "TTY rendering involves complex formatting logic, proper spacing and alignment, handling of terminal capabilities, and setting up the foundation for the more complex snippet rendering. The snapshot testing infrastructure is also non-trivial."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Source Code Snippet Rendering",
			"complexityScore": 9,
