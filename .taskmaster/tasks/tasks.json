Primary issues identified: Rule.match_at method creates expensive new anchored regex for each match attempt, multiple regex compilations occurring in hot path, lack of pre-compiled pattern optimization and regex object caching. Investigating Crystal's String#match with manual position tracking as alternative to substring creation for improved performance. Currently optimizing Rule class and Scanner scanning loop to address these performance critical areas.\n</info added on 2025-07-24T18:56:13.275Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-24T18:58:08.708Z>\nCompleted key performance optimizations with significant improvements achieved. Eliminated the major regex recompilation bottleneck by modifying Rule.match_at to use original pattern with position validation rather than creating new anchored regex objects for each match attempt, resulting in approximately 54% performance improvement. Implemented pre-allocated token arrays in Scanner with estimated capacity to reduce memory allocations during scanning. Added rule sorting optimization in RuleSet by priority (descending) then pattern complexity (ascending) to prioritize fast-matching rules.\n\nPerformance results show improvement from ~1,883 to ~2,900 tokens/second. Analysis indicates that reaching the 100k+ tokens/second target would require fundamental architectural changes including lower-level string scanning with Crystal's StringScanner, DFA-based lexing instead of regex matching, and more aggressive pattern pre-compilation and caching strategies. Current implementation provides solid foundation with reasonable performance for most use cases while maintaining correct and extensible Scanner architecture for future optimization work.\n</info added on 2025-07-24T18:58:08.708Z>",
